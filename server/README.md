## Features

- **Posts Management**: Users can create, view, edit, and delete their own posts.
- **Comments Management**: Users can create, edit, and delete their own comments. They can also view comments from other users on other posts as well.
- **Authentication**: Secure login using JWT tokens.
- **Role-Based Access**: Users and Admins have different access permissions based on their roles.
- **User Management**: Users with admin rights can create and delete any user. They can also edit certain information on a user's profile as well.
- **Jobs Management**: Users can dynamically add jobs to the database. When a user signs up, and if their job title isn't listed in the database, it is automatically created and added upon account creation.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js with Vite for fast development and optimized builds.
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js.
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ORM.
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- **Styling**: CSS.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js**: v14.x or later.
- **npm**: v6.x or later.
- **MongoDB**: A running MongoDB instance, either local or cloud-based (e.g., MongoDB Atlas).
- **Git**: To clone the repository.
- **Vite**: For frontend development.

## Installation

   ```bash
   npm install

4. **Navigate to the frontend directory**:
   ```bash
   cd client

5. **Install frontend dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install

6. **Create a <code>.env</code> file in the root directory with the following contents**:
   ```bash
   MONGODB_URI=<your-mongodb-uri>
   SECRET=<your-jwt-secret>
   PORT=9000
   NODE_ENV=development

7. **Optional: If using MongoDB locally, ensure the service is running**:
   ```bash
   mongod

## Running the Application

1. **Start the backend server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Start the frontend development server**:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm start
   ```
   
- The backend API will run at <code>http://localhost:5000</code>.
- The frontend will be accessible at <code>http://localhost:3000</code>.

# Deployment
   1. The application is deployed on Render.
      - Configure the environment variables on Render to match your <code>.env</code> file.

# Notes for Frontend Integration

1. Use `?withReactions=true` when fetching posts to include detailed reactions.
2. Reactions are nested under posts, no separate reaction routes are required.
3. Comments are fetched per post via `/api/comments/:postId`.
4. Soft deletion is used for posts; deleted posts have `isDeleted=true`.
5. Only owners or admins can update/delete posts, comments, or users.
6. Admin users can access all users; regular users can only update their own info.

# Future Enhancements
   - Email Notifications: Notify users when tasks are assigned or updated.
   - Priority and due date filters.
   - Better chatbot NLP and response context.
