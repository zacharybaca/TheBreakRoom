The backend server for Nine2Five, a social platform designed for workers in retail, customer service, and other public-facing roles. The application provides a space where users can share their daily experiences, vent frustrations, and seek advice from peers who understand the challenges of working the 9-to-5 grind.

## Features

- **Posts Management**: Users can create, view, edit, and delete their own posts.
- **Comments Management**: Users can create, edit, and delete their own comments. They can also view comments from other users on other posts as well.
- **Authentication**: Secure login using JWT tokens.
- **Role-Based Access**: Users and Admins have different access permissions based on their roles.
- **User Management**: Users with admin rights can create and delete any user. They can also edit certain information on a user's profile as well.
- **Jobs Management**: Users can dynamically add jobs to the database. When a user signs up, and if their job title isn't listed in the database, it is automatically created and added upon account creation.
- **Breakrooms**: A community-style feature where users can join groups that relate to their job, industry, or shared interests. Breakrooms act as smaller spaces within Nine2Five for more focused discussions.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js with Vite for fast development and optimized builds.
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js.
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ORM.
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- **Styling**: CSS.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js**: v14.x or later.
- **npm**: v6.x or later.
- **MongoDB**: A running MongoDB instance, either local or cloud-based (e.g., MongoDB Atlas).
- **Git**: To clone the repository.
- **Vite**: For frontend development.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zacharybaca/nine2five.git

   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd server

   ```

3. **Install backend dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install

   ```

4. **Navigate to the frontend directory**:

   ```bash
   cd client

   ```

5. **Install frontend dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install

   ```

6. **Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following contents**:

   ```bash
   MONGODB_URI=<your-mongodb-uri>
   SECRET=<your-jwt-secret>
   PORT=9000
   NODE_ENV=development

   ```

7. **Optional: If using MongoDB locally, ensure the service is running**:

   ```bash
   mongod
   ```

## Running the Application

1. **Start the backend server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Start the frontend development server**:

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm start
   ```

- The backend API will run at `http://localhost:5000`.
- The frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 📝 Notes

- Jobs are referenced by users on registration (`job` field).
- If a user registers with a job title that doesn’t exist yet, it’s **automatically created** in the database.

---

### 📝 Notes about avatar upload

- File must be an image ( jpeg, jpg, png, gif ), max 5MB.
- On success, the user's avatarUrl is updated to /uploads/filename.ext.
- Frontend can load it via: <http://localhost:5000/uploads/filename.ext>.

```

## Deployment

1. The application is deployed on Render.
   - Configure the environment variables on Render to match your `.env` file.

---

## Notes for Frontend Integration

1. Use `?withReactions=true` when fetching posts to include detailed reactions.
2. Reactions are nested under posts, no separate reaction routes are required.
3. Comments are fetched per post via `/api/comments/:postId`.
4. Soft deletion is used for posts; deleted posts have `isDeleted=true`.
5. Only owners or admins can update/delete posts, comments, or users.
6. Admin users can access all users; regular users can only update their own info.
7. Use JWT tokens in headers for all private routes:
   Authorization: Bearer {token}
8. Posts support withReactions=true query to fetch reaction details.
9. Soft delete means deleted posts have isDeleted=true but still exist in DB.
10. Admin users can access all users and delete posts/comments.
11. Reactions are one per user per post (upserted).
12. Breakrooms allow multiple memberships per user (users can join more than one).
13. Jobs link users with their profession and can be tied to Breakrooms for auto-suggestions.

## Future Enhancements

- Email Notifications: Notify users when tasks are assigned or updated.
- Priority and due date filters.
- Better chatbot NLP and response context.
